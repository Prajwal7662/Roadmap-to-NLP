📘 Roadmap to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository provides a complete, beginner-friendly to advanced Roadmap to NLP (Natural Language Processing). It is designed for students, data science learners, and AI practitioners who want to understand how machines process and understand human language.

🧠 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language.
NLP powers real-world applications such as:

Chatbots and Virtual Assistants

Sentiment Analysis

Machine Translation

Speech-to-Text systems

Question Answering (QA)

Text Summarization

Document Classification
